I’m Abhishek Saxena, an IT professional with 15 years’ experience building backend services in .NET and Python and front-ends with Angular and React. I’ve led technical teams to deliver multiple greenfield projects across varied domains, partnering with clients in Cruise, Finance, Saber (flight bookings) and Insurance. I hold a Bachelor’s degree (2010) from Uttar Pradesh Technical University and a Postgraduate Diploma in Artificial Intelligence from the National Institute of Warangal. Outside work I enjoy chess and tennis, and I’ve travelled extensively — including the USA, several countries in Europe, and Thailand.
